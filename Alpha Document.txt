What is Done: Splash Screen, simple start to game world, and battle system screens are finished, with most of the game built to be expanded onto easily.

In Progess/Needs to be Done:
Much more fleshed out game world with scrolling camera and various monsters
and items places around the map, leveling system with players and monsters, better artwork, boss fights

Known bugs: 
- player object goes back to original x,y coordinate when done with battle
- player can move off screen
- battle system needs to be changed to draw sprite at a specific coordinate
